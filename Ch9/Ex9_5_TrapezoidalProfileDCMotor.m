% In many applications we want to accelerate the motor to a desired speed and allow it to
% run at that speed for some time before decelerating to a stop. Investigate whether an
% applied voltage having a trapezoidal profile will accomplish this. Use the values R =0.6 V,
% L = 0.002 H, KT = 0.04 N * m/A, Ke = 0.04 V * s/rad, c = 0, and I = 6 * 10^â€“5kg * m^2.
